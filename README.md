# jgui

A Swing based library that covers components, frames, layouts, and other GUI concepts that are more specific than the more generalized low-level controls and widgits.

This was split off from jcontrols so that we better manage the specifity of controls vs. higher-level GUI concepts, as the controls should be generalized the most.
