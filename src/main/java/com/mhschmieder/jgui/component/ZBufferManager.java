/**
 * {@code ZBufferManager} is an interface that establishes the contract for
 * objects that support z-buffering of background images and cached vector
 * graphics. It is specific to the AWT and Swing frameworks as it relates to
 * helper methods that affect behavior in overrides of the
 * {@code paintComponent} method.
 * <p>
 * Just because a class implements this interface doesn't mean it has to
 * actually implement z-buffering of background images, but sometimes it is a
 * good idea to anticipate future needs and/or downstream clients and their
 * extra functionality in their class derivations.
