/**
 * {@code RenderingHintSource} is an interface that establishes a simple
 * contract for components that support {@link RenderingHints}. Even though
 * related methods are defined on {@code Graphics2D}, they are done so
 * abstractly, so there isn't even a basic default implementation to take
 * advantage of in AWT. All that was really needed was a forwarding method in
 * the {@code Component} class hierarchy, and this is what this interface
 * contracts its implementers to do.
 * <p>
 * Note that classes that implement this interface will also need to declare a
 * class variable for {@link RenderingHints} as this too was overlooked by the
 * AWT design team. I have not seen code examples anywhere that disprove my
 * point, but am open to being shown better ways of handling this situation.
 * <p>
 * This interface is not relegated to descendants of the {@code Component}
 * class; {@link RenderingHints} are also applicable to buffered images and
 * rendered images, but usually that is handled differently so this interface is
 * primarily purposed towards AWT and Swing components.
